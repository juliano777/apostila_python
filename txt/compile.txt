compile

    

compile is a lower level version of exec and eval. It does not execute or evaluate your statements or expressions, but returns a code object that can do it. The modes are as follows:

    compile(string, '', 'eval') returns the code object that would have been executed had you done eval(string). Note that you cannot use statements in this mode; only a (single) expression is valid.
    compile(string, '', 'exec') returns the code object that would have been executed had you done exec(string). You can use any number of statements here.
    compile(string, '', 'single') is like the exec mode, but it will ignore everything except for the first statement. Note that an if/else statement with its results is considered a single statement.

python3.7 -mtimeit -s 'code = "a = 2; b = 3; c = a * b"' 'exec(code)'


python3.7 -mtimeit -s 'code = compile("a = 2; b = 3; c = a * b", "<string>", "exec")' 'exec(code)'
